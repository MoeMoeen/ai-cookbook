# Introduction to the Crash Course

This crash course is designed to help you understand and apply **Pydantic AI** — the agent framework built by the creators of Pydantic. We will start from the fundamentals, explore its unique model-driven approach, and then move into more advanced topics like the Model Context Protocol (MCP), multi-agent orchestration, and production monitoring. By the end, you will understand not just *how* to use it, but *when* and *why* to use it in your own AI applications.

The course assumes you already have some experience building with large language models and want a more robust foundation for production systems. Instead of chasing the latest abstractions, we will focus on the principles that make AI software reliable, debuggable, and type-safe — the same values that made FastAPI and Pydantic so influential in modern Python development.
