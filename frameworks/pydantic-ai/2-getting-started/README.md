# Getting Started

Learn the minimal setup to build agents with Pydantic AI. This section covers the three fundamental patterns: basic text generation, model configuration, and structured outputs.

## Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv add pydantic-ai python-dotenv

# Create .env file
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here" > .env
```

## Run

```bash
uv run quickstart.py
```

## What You'll Learn

1. **Basic Agent** - Create and run your first agent
2. **Model Settings** - Control model behavior with parameters
3. **Structured Output** - Get type-safe, validated responses

These three patterns are the foundation for everything else in Pydantic AI.
